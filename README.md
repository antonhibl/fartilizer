# Fartilizer

**Fartilizer** is a Forge (1.19.2) mod that allows the player to release "fartilizing" gas when they sneak around! It 
primarily came about as I could not ind a mod that achieved quite what I wanted in terms of not having to spam/mash the 
sneak button to grow crops, trees, and sugarcane. Thus, I created this mod and decided it would be fun to add a few 
particle and sound effects to the idea to go with the "fartilizing" theme!
